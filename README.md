# Chapter2 - Write Workflow Agents
This chapter guides you through writing a simple workflow agents

This `README.md` is designed to showcase your architectural mindset. It does explain how to write a LLM agent and run the code; it explains **why** you chose this multi-agent pattern and how the **Google ADK** handles state, reasoning, and tool-use.

# 🚗 Friend Trip Agent: root_agent assist a trip planner for friends

An agentic orchestration system built with the **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)**. This project demonstrates a decoupled, multi-agent architecture designed to help friends to plan a vacation trip.

## 🏗️ Architectural Overview

This project moves away from monolithic prompts by utilizing a **Modular Multi-Agent System**. By separating concerns between specialized agents, we improve reliability, reduce token overhead, and allow for deterministic guardrails.

### The ADK Pipeline
The system utilizes a `LLM-Based Agents` a standalone Intelligent Worker to accomplish a specific task

1.  **root_agent (LLM-Based Agent):** Specialized in trip planner. It uses custom **Tools** to find friend availbility and frined budget for the trip.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Framework:** Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) v1.2+
* **Orchestration:** ADK `SequentialAgent` & `InMemoryRunner`
* **Models:** Gemini 2.5 Flash
* **Language:** Python 3.14+
* **Dev Tools:** ADK Web UI (for trace observability)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have a Google AI Studio and python 
```bash
uv init
```

```bash
uv venv
```
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat	
```

```bash
uv add google-adk 
```

### 2. Running the Agent
You can interact with the concierge via the terminal:
```bash
python agent.py
```

### 3. Visual Debugging (The ADK UI)
To see the "Thought-Action-Observation" loop in real-time, launch the development dashboard:
```bash
adk web
```
*Navigate to `localhost:8080` to view the agentic trace, event logs, and tool execution status.*

## 💡 Key Agent Patterns Implemented

### **Tool Decoupling**
Instead of the LLM "hallucinating" trip budget, This tool returns who are the freinds available for a trip and what is their budget.

### **Stateful Sessions**
Using the `ADK Session` service, the agent remembers user constraints (e.g., "2 friends shows availablity") across multiple turns without needing to re-send the entire chat history in every prompt.

### **Skill-Set Isolation**
The `get_FriendList` uses a specialized `SkillSet` for listing all the friends in the list.
The `get_friend_budget` uses a specialized `SkillSet` for availbility and budget.

## 🛤️ Roadmap
- [ ] **Cloud Deployment:** Migrate from `InMemoryRunner` to `CloudRunner` for deployment on **Vertex AI Agent Engine**.
- [ ] **Multi-Modal Support:** Use Gemini's vision capabilities to analyze places, wether, and other geolocations for vacation trip planner.

### Why this works for your GitHub:
* **Architectural Language:** Terms like "Decoupled," "Deterministic Guardrails," and "State Management" signal that you are a Software Architect, not just a casual coder.
* **Observability:** Mentioning the `ADK UI` shows you care about debugging and the lifecycle of an application.
* **Extensibility:** The roadmap shows you understand how to scale a local MVP into a production-grade cloud service.
